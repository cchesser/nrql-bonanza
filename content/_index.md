# Usage

Use NRQL to understand more about your data

* NrConsumption
* NrDailyUsage
* `bytecountestimate` function on entities

---

# Usage

`bytecountestimate`, as the name implies, [is an estimate](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts/#byte-count-estimate).

```sql{}
SELECT uniqueCount(apmAppName) 
FROM NrDailyUsage
FACET capture(apmAppName, r'(?P<appName>.*)\[.*') 
SINCE 30 days ago TIMESERIES 1 day
```

---

# Usage

NrDailyUsage to look at counts of application (what for spikes of growth)

```sql{}
SELECT uniqueCount(apmAppName) 
FROM NrDailyUsage
FACET apmAppName
SINCE 30 days ago TIMESERIES 1 day
```

---

# Usage

NrDailyUsage to look at counts of application, by categorizing on a application name prefix.

```sql{}
SELECT uniqueCount(apmAppName) 
FROM NrDailyUsage
-- Facet by application name prefix if you have (dash)
FACET capture(apmAppName, r'(?P<appName>.*)\-.*') 
SINCE 30 days ago TIMESERIES 1 day
```

---

# Usage

Compare metrics ingestion over 4 weeks to previous 4 weeks.

```sql{}
SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) AS avgGbIngestTimeseries
FROM NrConsumption 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' 
AND usageMetric = 'MetricsBytes'
SINCE 4 weeks ago COMPARE WITH 4 weeks ago TIMESERIES 1 day 
```
